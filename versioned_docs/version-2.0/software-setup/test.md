## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

### Plain Text
```
$ give me super-powers
```

:::info
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
:::

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```bash title="hello.sh"
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
